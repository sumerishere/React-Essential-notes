 --> emitting events typically refers to a pattern where a child component communicates 
    with its parent component by triggering an event. This pattern is commonly used when a 
    child component needs to inform its parent about changes or events that occur within 
    the child component.                          


                                   __________
                                   | Parent |
                                   |________|
                                     _
                                    /_\   |
                                     |    |
                       (Emit Events) |    | (pass Props)
                         informing   |    |    
                         to parent   |   \_/
                                    _________
                                    | Child |  
                                    |_______|  via target elemnt

                                      

   1. Pass dynamic behaviour between components.

   2. Enables upward communication from child to parent.

   3. Commonly used for event handling.

   4. Parent defines a function, child invokes it.

   5. Enhance components interactivity.

   6. Example : <Button onClick = {handleClick} />
     - {handleClick} method passed from parent to child for acting according to that  
        method. 



 *Why Emit Events? :
   - Communication between Components (parent-child).
   - Decoupling of Components mean emitting event to inform parent when somthing happen.
   

 *How to Emit Events? 

  1. Define Custom Events: 
      
      First, you define custom events that child components can emit. These events can 
      be any meaningful action or change that needs to be communicated to the parent   
      component.

  1. Handle Events in Parent Component: 
       
      Next, you define event handler functions in the parent component to respond to 
      these custom events. These event handlers are passed as props to child components.

  2. Emit Events in Child Component: 

      when something significant happens in the child component, such as a button click 
      or form submission, the child component emits the custom event, which is then  	    
      captured by the parent component's event handler.
