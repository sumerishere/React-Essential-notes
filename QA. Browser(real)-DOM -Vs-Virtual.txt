       // ----------- Browser(real) DOM  Vs Virtual DOM ------------//



--> The concept of the Virtual DOM in React is an abstraction that React uses to   
    efficiently update the user interface. The key difference between the 
    browser's real DOM and React's Virtual DOM lies in how updates and modifications 
    to the DOM are handled.


1. Real DOM (Browser's DOM):

    1. Direct Manipulation:
       - The Real DOM (Document Object Model) is the browser's internal representation   
         of the HTML document.When you manipulate the DOM directly using JavaScript, 
         the browser immediately re-renders the affected part of the page.

    2. Performance Implications:
       - Direct manipulation of the Real DOM can be inefficient, especially when making   
         frequent updates or modifications.Every change triggers a reflow and repaint 
         of the affected part of the page, which can be computationally expensive.


2. Virtual DOM (React's DOM):

    1. Abstraction Layer:
       - The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy or representation of the Real DOM maintained by  
         React.Instead of directly manipulating the Real DOM, React developers work with the  
         Virtual DOM.

    2. Diffing Algorithm:
       - When changes occur in the application state, React doesn't immediately update the Real  
         DOM. Instead, it calculates the difference (diff) between the new Virtual DOM and the   
         previous one.This process is known as reconciliation.

    3. Efficient Updates:
       - After calculating the differences, React determines the most efficient way to update 
         the Real DOM based on the minimal set of changes needed.React updates only the  
         specific components or elements that have changed, rather than re-rendering the 
         entire page.

    4. Batched Updates:
       - React batches multiple updates together, reducing the number of interactions with the  
         Real DOM.This batching approach helps optimize performance and reduces the frequency  
         of layout thrashing in the browser.

                                     * In-short *
 * Real DOM : 
    - Immediate and direct updates, leading to potential performance issues with  frequent  
      modifications.

 * Virtual DOM : 
    - Indirect updates through a lightweight representation, allowing React to  
      calculate and apply changes more efficiently.


Overall:
        React's use of the Virtual DOM helps improve performance by minimizing the number of 
        updates to the Real DOM and optimizing the update process based on the differences  
        between states. This abstraction makes it easier for developers to reason about and  
        manage the UI state in a declarative manner.
