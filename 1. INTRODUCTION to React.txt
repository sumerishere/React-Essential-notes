         // --------------- INTRODUCTION to React ----------//
                      (React is declarative unlike JS)


--> React.js, commonly referred to as React, is an open-source JavaScript library developed 
     by  Facebook. It is used for building user interfaces or UI components for web
     applications.React is particularly well-suited for creating single-page applications 
     (SPAs) where the content is dynamically updated without requiring a full page reload.

--> what is Imperative and Declarative mean ?
    1. Imperative:
       - Executing or doing something step-by-step in JS.
       - mean while JS is Imperative which required step-by-step procedure to do something.
       eg: writing whole JS code step-by-step.

    2. Declarative:
       - declarative mean direct focusing on goals unlike steps.
       - react having predefined things to do quickly.
        eg: components in react etc. 


--> Key concepts of react.js
    1. Component-Based Architecture: 
    2. Virtual DOM (Document Object Model):
    3. Declarative Syntax:
    4. JSX (JavaScript XML):
    5. One-Way Data Binding: 
    6. React Router: 


--> BAsic command to Create a React App : 
     - 1. npx create-react-app my-react-app.
     - 2. cd my-react-app.
     - 3. npm start.
 

--> MOdern way to create react app (using vite).
     - Offcial tool is CRA(create react app).
     - Vite is a modern tool to create react project.
     - Vite produces Quick and small bundle size.
     - Vite : Use npm run dev to launch dev server.
     - Use npm star for CRA. 
     - "npm create vite@latest" --> (creating node envirmnt).


--> Project Structure.
    1. node_modules/ has all the installed node packeges.

    2. public/ Dictionary: Contains static files that don't change.

    3. src/ Directory: Main folder for the React code.
       - 1. component/: Reusable parts of the UI, like buttons or headers.
       - 2. assets/: Images, fonts and other static files.
       - 3. styles/: CSS or stylesheets.

    4. packages.json contains information about this project like name, version, 
       dependencies on the react packages. 
  
    5. vite.config.js contains vite configuration.
