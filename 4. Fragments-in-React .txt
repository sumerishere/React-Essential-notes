           //--------------- Fragments in React -----------------//

1. What is fragments in react ?
   - Allows grouping of multiple elements without extra DOM nodes.
  

2. Why fragments ?
   - Return multiple elements without a wrapping parent.
   - Clear DOM and consistent styling.
 

--> Fragments are particularly useful when you don't want to add 
    unnecessary wrapper elements but still need to group multiple elements together.

--> Prior to the introduction of fragments, developers often used div elements as   
    wrappers, even when they weren't semantically necessary. Fragments allow you 
    to achieve the same grouping effect without introducing a new node in the DOM.

Syntax : 
           <React.Fragment> ... </React.Fragment>
                       oR
            in short : <>... </>
