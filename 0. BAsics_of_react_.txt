//-------------- the Advantages of Implementing React JS in Your Development ------------//


1. Component-Based :-
    React is a component-based framework, which means that developers can build reusable  
    components that can be used throughout an application. Code becomes more modular and    
    simpler to maintain as a result.

2. Declarative :-
    React is declarative, meaning that code is written in a way that is easy to read and  
    understand. This makes development faster and simpler since developers don’t have to  
    spend time deciphering complex code.

3. Virtual DOM :-
    React uses a virtual DOM, which means that it only updates the components that need 
    to be updated rather than re-rendering the entire page. This makes applications more   
    responsive and fast.

4. JSX Support :-
    JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML directly in 
    your JavaScript code. This makes development with React more convenient, as you don’t 
    have to switch between files when working on markup and logic.
