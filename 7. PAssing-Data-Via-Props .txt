                  // ---------- PAssing Data Via Props ----------- //
                              Props (short for properties)

1.Props in React:
  - Props (Short for properties).
  - Mechanism for passing data.
  - Read-only by default.
  
2.Usage:
  - Pass data from parent to child component.
  - Makes Components resuable.
  - Defined as attribute in Jsx.
  
3.Key Points:
  - Data flows one-way (downwards).
  - Props are immutable.
  - Used for communication betwn components.
  - A separation of logic would be better for complex projects.


Overalll:

   - Props are used to transmit information, configurations, or functions from a 
     higher-level component to a lower-level component in the component tree.
   - They are essentially arguments that are passed to React components as attributes. 
     Props are read-only and should not be modified by the child component.
   - Props are part of React's component-based architecture.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.Examples:

     <Header title = "My App"/>
     - props are like an attributes of HTML input tag.
       eg: type="text", placeholder="enter here" etc.
  
 --> Props (short for properties) are a way to pass data from a parent component 
     to a child component in React. Here's a basic example of how you can pass 
     data via props:

           
  **props in parent-child relationships.     
              ________
              |parent|
                /   \
       (props) /     \ (props)
              /       \
          _______   _______
          |child|   |child| 
            /           \
    (props)/             \ (props)
          /               \
    _____________       _____________
    |grand child|      | grand child|

 cOde Snippet :

       1. Parent component:

                import React from 'react';
		import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';

		function ParentComponent() {
 		   const message = 'Hello from the Parent!';

 		   return (
   		     <div>
     		       <h1>{message}</h1>
     		         <ChildComponent message={message} />
    		     </div>
  		   );
	         }

	         export default ParentComponent;


      2. Child Components:

       		import React from 'react';
	
		function ChildComponent(props) {
  		     return <p>{props.message}</p>;
		}

		export default ChildComponent;
