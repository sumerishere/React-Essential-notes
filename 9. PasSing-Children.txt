            //---------------------- PasSing Children ----------------------//
                                  (or passing component)




1. Children is a special prop for passing elements into components.

2. Used for flexible and reusable components designs.

3. Accessed with (props.children).

4. Commmon in layout or container components.

5. Can be any content: strings, numbers, JSX, or components.

6. Enhances component composability  and reusability.


--> In React, you can pass content (children) to a component by placing it between the opening  
    and closing tags of the component. The content will then be accessible within the component 
    as the children prop. This is often used to create reusable components that can wrap around  
    other content.

--> In props, we it pass as attribute to components to make changes itself or to make some
    operation by taking some props value as attribute.

 But,
   - now the thing is, passing children is bit different compared to props if we see How?
    
   - we pass props as attribute in component tag but, in passing children we decleared 
     children in opening/closing tag of component instead using it in sigle tag like props.
     which mean the component doesn't care about passing children what it should be 
     it could be anything like complex structure or somthing diff for rendering component
     doesn't care of it.  --> kind of abstraction we can say for components. 
   
*note : passing children nothing but the passing one component to another component.

   short example :
                       
                     1. // ParentComponent.js

			import React from 'react';

			function ParentComponent({ children }) {
  			    return (
   				<div>
				   <h2>This is the parent component</h2>
      				   {children}
    				</div>
  			    );
			 }

			export default ParentComponent;

                             |
                            _|_     
                            \_/       

              2. // AnotherComponent.js

		import React from 'react';
		import ParentComponent from './ParentComponent';

		function AnotherComponent() {
 		    return (
    		      <ParentComponent>
      		         <p>This is the content passed as children</p>
      			 <button>Click me</button>
    		      </ParentComponent>
  		   );
  		}

		export default AnotherComponent;


 In this example:
   
   - The ParentComponent receives the content between its opening and closing tags as the  
     children prop.
   - The AnotherComponent uses ParentComponent and places a paragraph and a button inside it.
   - The content passed between the tags of ParentComponent is rendered inside the div.


Overall : 
     The children prop can be any valid React node, including text, components, or even  
     complex structures. It allows for the creation of flexible and reusable components 
     that can wrap around different content.
